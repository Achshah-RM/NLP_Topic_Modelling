    "# Task 1: Use NLP Techniques to Analyze a Collection of Texts\n",
    "## Objective:\n",
    "The goal of this project is to analyze a large collection of consumer complaints using unsupervised natural language processing (NLP) techniques. By applying advanced topic modeling algorithms, this project aims to uncover prevalent themes and latent topics within the data. These insights can provide valuable support to policymakers and organizations in addressing critical consumer issues, enhancing decision-making, and improving service quality.\n",
    "## Problem Statement:\n",
    "Consumer complaint data, such as the dataset from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), is inherently unstructured and noisy. These complaints often contain irregular formatting, varied language usage, and redundant information, making direct systematic analysis challenging. The volume of data further complicates identifying the most pressing concerns. Traditional manual approaches are insufficient to extract meaningful patterns from such data.\n",
    "Topic modeling offers an effective solution to these challenges by uncovering latent structures and organizing the complaints into coherent themes. This project leverages algorithms like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and BERTopic to identify key topics, enabling a systematic understanding of consumer grievances and supporting data-driven decisions."
